# NetsBlox Cloud
This contains:
- a new implementation of the NetsBlox cloud server (ie, excluding services) with enhanced performance and security (among other things - for a complete list, check out `./crates/cloud/README.md`).
- a CLI for interacting with the cloud server
- a client for interacting with the cloud server (used by the CLI)
- migration crate for migrating data from the old JS NetsBlox server

## Versioning
To simplify determining compatibility, all crates share the same version number using semantic versioning. This may change in the future to give the CLI and server both a version number and an API version number (similar to docker). This is already somewhat there but hasn't yet been made official. (I would expect an autogenerated compatibility table and/or version numbers reported by the CLI itself for the server, server API, client, and client API.)

## Quick Start
This has yet to be completed but we are planning to make this available as a docker image. If you want to build from source, check out the development section.

## Development
First, install stable rust ([rustup](https://rustup.rs/) recommended). Then run with
```
cd crates/cloud
cargo run
```
To customize the deployment, check out the [configuration file](./crates/cloud/config/default.toml).

Check out the [architecture](./architecture.md) document for an overview of the codebase.
